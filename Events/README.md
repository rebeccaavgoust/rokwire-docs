<P align-center>
  <IMG width = 400 height = 400 SRC = "https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-community/blob/master/Media%20Assets/Docathon%20(general%20poster).png">
    </P>

#### Attendees   
  
     Sample table shown below (with Markdown code for a 4x3 table). All categories are arbitrary. You should make this table amenable to collaborator access (what do your attendees need to work together). "Other" can be links to personal webpages, description of why you are here. 

|      Attendee Name    |    Affiliation     |   Contact Information   |     Other           |
|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
|                       |                    |                         |                     |
|                       |                    |                         |                     |
