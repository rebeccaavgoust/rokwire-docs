# Converge Engine Capability


**What Is the Converge Engine?** The Converge Engine is a third-party Rokwire Capability that curates and rates events to make recommendations based on a Rokwire user's interests. 


**Synopsis:** 
	
**Description:** The Converge Engine is a flexible decision-making engine that helps users find content that best matches their interests. Within the Rokwire platform, the Converge Engine provides personalized recommendations for events based on both the explicitly and implicitly indicated interests of the users, and by correlating the interests of many Rokwire users.

Rokwire uses the Converge Engine to score and order the results that appear on the events panel of the *Illinois* app, helping community members find events around campus that match their interests, which they might not have otherwise known about. 

**Interactions with the Illinois App**
The Illinois app utilizes the smarts of the Converge service to help users pick events that match their interests. When Illinois app users select a privacy setting that allows their interest selections and history of "favorites" to be processed by authorized Rokwire Capabilities, Converge evaluates  a selection of available events and rates them based on their likelihood of meeting a user's preferences. Converge returns the highest rated events as recommendations for the user under the heading "Events for you". A percentage match score is also shown. (sometimes?)

**Building Block Interaction:** The Converge Engine receives data from the following Building Blocks:
- Events
- Profile

Does Converge send data back to the Events Building Block? Or directly to the app?

**Fee Basis:** The Converge Capability is available to users of Rokwire at no charge.

**Licensing:** ??

**Developers:** Stephen Hurwit (and others). The Converge Engine was created by this software developer team when they were students in the [Alchemy Incubator](https://alchemyfoundry.com/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
